BS (Computer Science)
Introduction
The BS Computer Science program at QAU was started in 2013. It provides a well-integrated balance of theoretical and practical knowledge required for developing reliable and usable software tools for different fields. The program enables students to design, implement and manage systems combining scientific, computational, communication and multimedia facilities in different domains. The BS program is accredited by National Computing Education Accreditation Council (NCEAC).

BS Program Structure
During the B.S. students will be informed through research expertise of the faculty about the current and future issues affecting the usage and development of computer-based systems. Initially students learn basics of computing discipline through foundation courses and will build their knowledge of the discipline through core courses. In the last three semesters students will extend their knowledge in a focus area of their choice through elective courses. The final year compulsory project will give students the opportunity to consolidate and demonstrate the knowledge and skills gained from the entire course material.

Focus Areas
After providing the students with a solid foundation based on foundation and core courses in Computing, the BS program will give students the opportunity to enrich their knowledge in an area through elective courses. These elective courses will on one hand provide in-depth knowledge, and on the other will enable students to work on and solve practical problems in the area by using latest techniques and tools. Some focus areas are:

Artificial Intelligence
Data Science
Software Engineering
Human Centered Computing
Information Systems
Networks and Security

Courses Overview
Four years of BS program is divided into eight semesters. In each semester, students are offered 15 to 18 credit hours of courses, where one credit hour means one hour of teaching (or three hours of lab) per week. The courses are divided into four groups:

University courses are required to be studied by every student of the university, irrespective of their department.
Faculty courses are offered from other departments of Faculty of Natural Sciences (FNS), Faculty of Biological Sciences (FBS), and Faculty of Social Sciences (FSS).
Computer science foundation & core courses are offered by the department of computer sciences and have to be studied by every student of BS (CS).
Elective courses allow students to specialize in their field of interest. They are offered in the last three semesters.
